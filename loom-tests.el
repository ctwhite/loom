;;; loom-tests.el --- Comprehensive ERT Test Suite for the Loom Library -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains the final, comprehensive ERT test suite for the Loom
;; concurrency library. It is structured with a unit-testing philosophy,
;; providing dedicated tests for each public function, followed by tests for
;; more complex scenarios and edge cases.
;;
;; The tests are organized into sections that correspond to the major
;; files in the Loom library.
;;
;; This test suite assumes that all Loom library files (`loom-*.el`) have
;; been loaded or are available in the Emacs `load-path`.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)

(require 'loom-errors)
(require 'loom-lock)
(require 'loom-queue)
(require 'loom-priority-queue)
(require 'loom-registry)
(require 'loom-microtask)
(require 'loom-scheduler)
(require 'loom-config)
(require 'loom-promise)
(require 'loom-primitives)
(require 'loom-combinators)
(require 'loom-cancel)
(require 'loom-event)
