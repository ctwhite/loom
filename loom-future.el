;;; loom-future.el --- Lazy Asynchronous Computations -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides primitives for working with "futures". A future
;; represents a deferred computation that is evaluated lazilyâ€”only when its
;; result is actually requested. This is useful for defining expensive or
;; asynchronous operations without paying the execution cost upfront.
;;
;; Futures are built on top of promises. When a future is "forced" (i.e., its
;; value is requested for the first time via `loom:force`), it executes its
;; deferred computation and stores the result in an internal promise for all
;; subsequent requests.
;;
;; ## Key Features:
;;
;; - **Lazy Evaluation:** A future's computation is only run once, the
;;   first time its result is needed.
;; - **Thread-Safety:** Forcing a future is an atomic, thread-safe operation,
;;   preventing race conditions where multiple threads might try to evaluate
;;   the same future simultaneously.
;; - **Seamless Integration:** Futures are "awaitable" and integrate
;;   transparently with the entire `loom` promise ecosystem (`loom:await`,
;;   `loom:then`, etc.).
;; - **Memoization:** Future results are cached (memoized) in an internal
;;   promise, so subsequent requests for the result are fast and do not
-;;   trigger re-computation.
;; - **Composability:** Futures can be chained, combined, and transformed
;;   using a suite of combinator functions (`loom:future-then`,
;;   `loom:future-all`, etc.).

  "A lazy future representing a deferred computation.
This struct encapsulates a 'thunk' (a zero-argument function) that
will be executed at most once, the first time its result is
requested via `loom:force`. The result is stored in an internal
promise, making the future compatible with all other promise-based
operations in the Loom library.

Fields:
- `id` (symbol): A unique identifier for logging and debugging.
- `promise` (loom-promise or nil): The cached promise that holds the
  result of the computation. It is created on the first call to
  `loom:force`.
- `thunk` (function): A zero-argument closure that performs the
  computation and returns a value or signals an error.
- `evaluated-p` (boolean): A flag to ensure the `thunk` is only run once.
- `lock` (loom-lock): A mutex ensuring that the `force` operation is
  atomic and thread-safe, preventing multiple threads from
  evaluating the thunk simultaneously.
- `cancelled-p` (boolean): A flag indicating whether this future has
  been cancelled before evaluation.
- `metadata` (plist): A property list for storing additional
  user-defined metadata for debugging and introspection."
