;;; loom-future.el --- Lazy Asynchronous Computations -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides primitives for working with "futures". A future
;; represents a deferred computation that is evaluated lazilyâ€”only when its
;; result is actually requested. This is useful for defining expensive or
;; asynchronous operations without paying the execution cost upfront.
;;
;; Futures are built on top of promises. When a future is "forced" (i.e., its
;; value is requested for the first time via `loom:force`), it executes its
;; deferred computation and stores the result in an internal promise for all
;; subsequent requests.
;;
;; Key Features:
;; - Lazy Evaluation: A future's computation is only run once, the first
;;   time its result is requested via `loom:force`.
;; - Thread-Safety: Forcing a future is an atomic, thread-safe operation,
;;   making it safe to share futures across different threads.
;; - Seamless Integration: Futures are "awaitable" and integrate transparently
;;   with the entire `loom` promise ecosystem (`loom:await`, `loom:then`).

Arguments:
