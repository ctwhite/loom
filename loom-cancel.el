;;; loom-cancel.el --- Primitives for Cooperative Cancellation -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides the core primitives for **cooperative cancellation**
;; of asynchronous tasks within the Loom framework. The central concept is
;; the `loom-cancel-token`, a thread-safe object that represents a
;; cancellation signal that can be passed among different functions and
;; threads.
;;
;; ## Key Concepts
;;
;; - **Cooperative Cancellation:** Cancellation is not preemptive. An
;;   asynchronous task must be explicitly designed to "cooperate" by
;;   periodically checking a cancellation token (e.g., via
;;   `loom:throw-if-cancelled`) and aborting its work if signaled.
;;
;; - **Cancellation Propagation:** A `loom-cancel-token` can have
;;   callbacks registered on it. When the token is signaled (via
;;   `loom:cancel-token-signal`), all registered callbacks are executed
;;   asynchronously on the microtask queue. This allows cancellation
;;   signals to be propagated to promises, child tasks, or other parts of
;;   the system.
;;
;; - **Thread-Safety:** All operations that modify a token's state are
;; Â  thread-safe, using an internal mutex to prevent race conditions.
;;
;; ## Basic Usage
;;
;; 1. Create a token source:
;;    (let ((token (loom:cancel-token "my-task-token")))
;;      ...)
;;
;; 2. Pass the token to an async function, which registers a callback:
;;    (my-async-op-with-token promise token)
;;
;; 3. When you want to cancel, signal the token:
;;    (loom:cancel-token-signal token "User requested cancellation.")
