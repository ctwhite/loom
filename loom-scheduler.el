;;; loom-scheduler.el --- Generalized Task Scheduler for Concur -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides a generalized, prioritized, and optionally adaptive
;; scheduler for executing asynchronous tasks in batches. It primarily serves
;; as the **macrotask scheduler** for the `Concur` promise library, using
;; Emacs's idle timer to defer execution and prevent UI blocking while
;; performing background work.
;;
;; The scheduler is designed for robustness. It uses an internal `:running-p`
;; state flag to ensure processing ticks are discrete and to prevent
;; re-entrancy issues. It efficiently manages its internal timer, ensuring
;; it is active only when there is actual work to do in the queue.
;;
;; Key functionalities:
;; - **Prioritized Queue:** Tasks can be enqueued with a priority, ensuring
;;   higher-priority tasks are processed first.
;; - **Adaptive Delay:** Can dynamically adjust the delay between processing
;;   cycles based on the queue size, optimizing responsiveness versus CPU usage.
;; - **Non-Blocking Execution:** Leverages Emacs's idle timer
;;   (`run-with-idle-timer`) to ensure processing happens cooperatively when
;;   Emacs is idle, preserving UI responsiveness during long-running tasks.

;;; Struct Definitions

(cl-defstruct (loom-scheduler (:constructor %%make-scheduler) (:copier nil))
  "A generalized, prioritized task scheduler for deferred execution.

This scheduler is designed to run 'macrotasks'â€”units of work that can be
deferred to a future idle moment in Emacs, preventing the UI from freezing.

Fields:
- `id` (symbol): A unique identifier for the scheduler instance, used for
  logging and debugging.
- `queue` (loom-priority-queue): The internal priority queue that holds
  the tasks waiting for execution.
- `lock` (loom-lock): A mutex that protects the queue and other internal
  state fields (`timer`, `running-p`) from race conditions.
- `timer` (timer or nil): The Emacs `idle-timer` object that drives the
  scheduler's processing ticks. It is `nil` if the scheduler is inactive.
- `running-p` (boolean): A flag that is `t` while the scheduler is actively
  processing a batch of tasks. This prevents re-entrant timer calls.
- `batch-size` (integer): The maximum number of tasks to process in a
  single execution cycle.
- `adaptive-delay-p` (boolean): If `t`, the scheduler uses a dynamic delay
  between cycles based on queue size.
- `min-delay` (float): The minimum delay in seconds for the timer when
  adaptive delay is enabled.
- `max-delay` (float): The maximum delay in seconds for the timer when
  adaptive delay is enabled.
- `process-fn` (function): A mandatory function `(lambda (batch))` that is
  invoked with a list of tasks to process.
- `delay-strategy-fn` (function): A function `(lambda (scheduler))` that
  computes the next timer delay. Defaults to an adaptive strategy."
