;;; loom-scheduler.el --- Generalized Task Scheduler for Loom -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides a generalized, prioritized, and optionally adaptive
;; scheduler for executing asynchronous tasks in batches. It is designed to
;; serve as the primary **macrotask scheduler** for promise libraries like
;; `Concur`, using Emacs's idle timer system (`run-with-idle-timer`) to defer
;; execution and prevent blocking the user interface during background work.
;;
;; ## Core Design
;;
;; The scheduler is designed for robustness and efficiency. It uses an internal
;; `:running-p` state flag to ensure processing "ticks" are discrete and to
;; prevent re-entrancy issues, which could occur with idle timers. It
;; efficiently manages its internal timer, ensuring it is active only when
;; there is actual work to do in the queue, thereby consuming zero resources
;; when idle.
;;
;; ## Key Features
;;
;; - **Prioritized Queue:** Tasks can be enqueued with a priority (or via a
;;   custom comparator), ensuring higher-priority tasks are processed first.
;; - **Cooperative, Non-Blocking Execution:** It leverages Emacs's
;;   `run-with-idle-timer` to ensure processing happens only when Emacs is
;;   idle. This is ideal for background tasks that should not impact UI
;;   responsiveness.
;; - **Adaptive Delay:** The scheduler can dynamically adjust the delay between
;;   processing cycles based on the queue size, balancing responsiveness
;;   (shorter delay for a busy queue) against CPU usage (longer delay for a
;;   quiet queue).
;; - **Batch Processing:** It processes tasks in configurable batches rather
;;   than one at a time, which is more efficient for handling bursts of tasks.

  "A generalized, prioritized task scheduler for deferred execution.

This scheduler is designed to run 'macrotasks'â€”units of work that can be
deferred to a future idle moment in Emacs, preventing the UI from freezing.

Fields:
- `id` (symbol): A unique identifier (`gensym`) for the scheduler instance,
  used for logging and debugging.
- `queue` (loom-priority-queue): The internal priority queue holding tasks.
- `lock` (loom-lock): A mutex protecting the queue and the `timer` and
  `running-p` state fields from race conditions.
- `timer` (timer or nil): The Emacs `idle-timer` object that drives the
  scheduler's processing ticks. It is `nil` if the scheduler is inactive.
- `running-p` (boolean): A flag that is `t` while the scheduler is actively
  processing a batch. This serves as a re-entrancy guard.
- `batch-size` (integer): The max number of tasks to process in one cycle.
- `adaptive-delay-p` (boolean): If `t`, use a dynamic delay between cycles.
- `min-delay` (float): Minimum delay for the adaptive timer.
- `max-delay` (float): Maximum delay for the adaptive timer.
- `process-fn` (function): A mandatory function `(lambda (batch))` that is
  invoked with a list of tasks dequeued from the queue.
- `delay-strategy-fn` (function): A function `(lambda (scheduler))` that
  computes the next timer delay. Defaults to an adaptive strategy."
